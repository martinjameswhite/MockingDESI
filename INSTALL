Instructions on how to install the packages, and a list
of dependencies.

Our goal is to minimize the dependencies of this package
on other libraries or routines, in order the increase
interoperability, reduce barriers to entry and make it
easier to deploy in a HPC environment.  However several
packages are used throughout:

Python (2.7.9 or later)
Numpy  (1.9.2 or later)
Matplotlib (1.4.3 or later)
Modern C++ compiler, such as g++ v4.3.4 or later

You should set up an environment variable pointing to this
directory, e.g.
export MOCKINGDESI_BASE=`pwd`
