Codes associated with QSO mocks.

This set of codes takes pre-computed boxes of QSOs,
projects them onto the sky, generates observed magnitudes
and then applies an approximation to the DESI selection
function to them.

A driver code, which is set up to submit jobs on NERSCs Cori
system, is provided as "driver.py".

The data are converted from FITS to FileHandler format for
intermediate steps in the processing, and then the final
results are repackaged into FITS files at the end.

The boxes of QSOs for the v1.0 mocks are described in "qso_mock_v1.0.pdf"
and some notes on the projection, K-corrections, counts etc. are provided
in "qso_select.pdf".

The projection from boxes onto the sky, including possible periodic
replication of remapping of the box, is handled by the "box2sky" code
in "generic".

add_magnitude.py uses the distance modulus computed by box2sky, and a
tabulated K-correction in "data" along with a polynomial fit to the g-i
color to generate "observed" g-band magnitudes.

select_qso.py applies an approximation to the DESI selection function.
