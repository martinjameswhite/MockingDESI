This directory holds data files which are used as inputs to the
mock codes, not data files which are outputs.
Examples could include information on the DESI footprint or the
redshift distributions, k-corrections, efficiencies, etc.
Many of these files will be the output of scripts.

#Description of files
Ndzdg_QSO.dat.txt   This contains expected QSO density in DESI as the function of redshift and observed g band magnitude

tiles.ply	An ascii Mangle mask giving the survey region for DESI.  This is generated by the make_mangle_mask.py code in util operating on "desi-tiles.fits" on the DESI Wiki in code/desimodel/trunk/data/footprint

tiles.pix.ply	A pixelized version of the above mask.

qso-iband-k-correction.txt	A tabulated K-correction for converting from absolute i-band magnitude in the Richards06 scheme to apparent i-band magnitude, taken from Table 6 of Richards++06.
